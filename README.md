# **Basic Mathematics in R**

## **Overview**
This project is a computational exploration of concepts from the book *Basic Mathematics* by Serge Lang. The goal is to translate the mathematical principles into R code and present them using Quarto for clear documentation and reproducibility.

## **Motivation**
- To deepen my understanding of mathematical concepts.
- To practice implementing mathematical ideas in R.
- To create an educational resource for others interested in mathematics and R programming.

## **Contents**
- **R Code**: Implementations of mathematical concepts, including functions, visualizations, and simulations.
- **Quarto Documents**: Tutorials that explain the theory, provide examples, and demonstrate R-based computations.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs and plots illustrating key ideas from geometry, algebra, and calculus.
